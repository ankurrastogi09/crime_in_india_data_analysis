# crime_in_india_data_analysis
India is one of the most populous countries with a population of over one billion. It is intriguing to analyze the crime data of India because of its diversity and the problems that arise due to it. Also, we chose this topic because we are familiar with the diversities in India, its culture, politics, people, law and police. Thus, it helps us in coming up with better hypothesis and arrive at some meaningful insights.

Here, we do an analysis of crimes committed in India in the past years (2001-2014) to predict the following:
  * Crime pattern
  * Effect of criminal event on people
  * Different factors contributing to crime rate 

We predict the crime pattern by making use of Linear Regression and Time Series Analysis. Also, we make use of Wald’s test and Paired T-test to test the effect of criminal event on people by comparing the crime rate before and after a criminal event. We find out how different factors affecting the crime rate by comparing the crime rate in two different states with different factors such as literacy rate and male/female ratio.
	
Overall, we have categorized our hypothesis into four different topics:
  * Demographics
  * Sexual Crime
  * Political Party
  * Law Enforcement


In “Demographics”, we have hypothesis that predicts the crime rate for the coming years and how different factors (for example - literacy rate) affect the crime rate. In “Sexual Crime”, we have hypothesis that test how a criminal incident (Nirbhaya criminal incident) affected the general population in that Delhi compared to other states. In “Political Party”, we analyze how crime rate is dependent on different political parties ruling that state. “Law Enforcement” topic provides information about how effective a law has been by analyzing the crime rate before and after a particular law came into effect. It also provides information about the kind of crime that will increase in the coming years and thus helping the police force to better manage the situation.
